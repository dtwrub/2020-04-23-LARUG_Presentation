# Summary

At the Fall 2019 American Chemical Society National Meeting, two chemistry librarians partnered with a chemistry faculty member to offer a hands-on computer programming workshop. The workshop used the R programming environment and was structured for beginners with no previous experience with it. Three main topics were covered during the five-hour session: introduction to R, working with QSAR data, and creating a report using R Markdown. This report will cover the workshop’s logistics, instructional design and content, and discuss feedback received from participants. Suggestions for future improvements will also be discussed.

# Event Goals and Target Audience

--

Provide intro to the R programming environment for chemists

--

Script-based data analysis and authoring tools allow chemists to streamline data workflows and enhance reproducibility

--

Improve transparency and reproducibility of research processes

--

Hands-on learning experience for participants

--

Resources for participants to share with their communities

--

Intended audience: attendees at the Fall 2019 ACS National Meeting: chemical information professionals, students, and librarians

---

# Logistics

--

Date and time: Saturday, August 24, 2019, 9am-2pm, two short breaks and a longer break for lunch

Location: Omni Hotel, an ACS Conference Hotel and in close proximity to the convention center

---

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')
grep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

class: center, middle
