## Summary

At the Fall 2019 American Chemical Society National Meeting, two chemistry librarians partnered with a chemistry faculty member to offer a hands-on computer programming workshop. The workshop used the R programming environment and was structured for beginners with no previous experience with it. Three main topics were covered during the five-hour session: introduction to R, working with QSAR data, and creating a report using R Markdown. This report will cover the workshopâ€™s logistics, instructional design and content, and discuss feedback received from participants. Suggestions for future improvements will also be discussed.
