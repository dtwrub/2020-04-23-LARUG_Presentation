# Summary

At the Fall 2019 American Chemical Society National Meeting, two chemistry librarians partnered with a chemistry faculty member to offer a hands-on computer programming workshop. The workshop used the R programming environment and was structured for beginners with no previous experience with it. Three main topics were covered during the five-hour session: introduction to R, working with QSAR data, and creating a report using R Markdown. This report will cover the workshopâ€™s logistics, instructional design and content, and discuss feedback received from participants. Suggestions for future improvements will also be discussed.

Provide intro to the R programming environment for chemists

--

Script-based data analysis and authoring tools allow chemists to streamline data workflows and enhance reproducibility

--

Improve transparency and reproducibility of research processes

--

Hands-on learning experience for participants

--

Resources for participants to share with their communities

--

Intended audience: attendees at the Fall 2019 ACS National Meeting: chemical information professionals, students, and librarians

---

# Logistics

--

Date and Time: Saturday, August 24, 2019, 9am-2pm, two short breaks and a longer break for lunch

--

Location of Workshop: Omni Hotel, an ACS Conference Hotel and in close proximity to the convention center

--

Number of Attendees: 18

--

Cost of Workshop: 
- Instructors donated their time
- Each participant paid a $40 registration fee
- ACS Publications generously sponsored the rest of the facilities fees
- ACS Division of Chemical Information provided logistical support and contingency funding
